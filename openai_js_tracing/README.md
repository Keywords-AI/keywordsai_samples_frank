# OpenAI JS Tracing

This project contains JavaScript-based tracing implementation for OpenAI API calls.

## ⚠️ Windows Compatibility Issue

**Note: This project is currently not working on Windows systems.**

The implementation relies on certain Unix-specific features and dependencies that are not compatible with the Windows environment. 

## Supported Platforms

- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Linux
- ❌ Windows (not supported)

## Known Issues

- Windows users may experience compatibility issues with the tracing mechanisms
- Some dependencies may not install or function properly on Windows
- File path handling may cause issues on Windows systems

## Alternatives for Windows Users

If you're using Windows, consider:
- Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Running the project in a Docker container
- Using a macOS or Linux virtual machine

## Future Plans

We're working on making this project cross-platform compatible, including full Windows support in future releases.
